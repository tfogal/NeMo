Introduction
------------

NVIDIA NeMo Framework is a generative AI framework built for researchers and pytorch developers
working on large language models (LLMs), multimodal models (MM), automatic speech recognition (ASR),
and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS).
The primary objective of NeMo is to provide a scalable framework for researchers and developers from industry and academia
to more easily implement and design new generative AI models by being able to leverage existing code and pretrained models.

For technical documentation, please see the `NeMo Framework User Guide <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html>`_.

All NeMo models are trained with `Lightning <https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning>`_ and
training is automatically scalable to 1000s of GPUs.

When applicable, NeMo models take advantage of the latest possible distributed training techniques,
including parallelism strategies such as

* data parallelism
* tensor parallelism
* pipeline model parallelism
* fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP)
* sequence parallelism
* context parallelism
* mixture-of-experts (MoE)

and mixed precision training recipes with bfloat16 and FP8 training.

NeMo's Transformer based LLM and Multimodal models leverage `NVIDIA Transformer Engine <https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine>`_ for FP8 training on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs
and leverages `NVIDIA Megatron Core <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core>`_ for scaling transformer model training.

NeMo LLMs can be aligned with state of the art methods such as SteerLM, DPO and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
see `NVIDIA NeMo Aligner <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner>`_ for more details.

NeMo LLM and Multimodal models can be deployed and optimized with `NVIDIA Inference Microservices (Early Access) <https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-microservices-early-access>`_.

NeMo ASR and TTS models can be optimized for inference and deployed for production use-cases with `NVIDIA Riva <https://developer.nvidia.com/riva>`_.

For scaling NeMo LLM and Multimodal training on Slurm clusters or public clouds, please see the `NVIDIA Framework Launcher <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher>`_.
The NeMo Framework launcher has extensive recipes, scripts, utilities, and documentation for training NeMo LLMs and Multimodal models and also has an `Autoconfigurator <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher#53-using-autoconfigurator-to-find-the-optimal-configuration>`_
which can be used to find the optimal model parallel configuration for training on a specific cluster.
To get started quickly with the NeMo Framework Launcher, please see the `NeMo Framework Playbooks <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html>`_
The NeMo Framework Launcher does not currently support ASR and TTS training but will soon.

Getting started with NeMo is simple.
State of the Art pretrained NeMo models are freely available on `HuggingFace Hub <https://huggingface.co/models?library=nemo&sort=downloads&search=nvidia>`_ and
`NVIDIA NGC <https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models?query=nemo&orderBy=weightPopularDESC>`_.
These models can be used to generate text or images, transcribe audio, and synthesize speech in just a few lines of code.

We have extensive `tutorials <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/starthere/tutorials.html>`_ that
can be run on `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com>`_ or with our `NGC NeMo Framework Container. <https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo>`_
and we have `playbooks <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html>`_ for users that want to train NeMo models with the NeMo Framework Launcher.

For advanced users that want to train NeMo models from scratch or finetune existing NeMo models
we have a full suite of `example scripts <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/examples>`_ that support multi-GPU/multi-node training.

    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
    cd NeMo
    ./reinstall.sh

If you only want the toolkit without additional conda-based dependencies, you may replace ``reinstall.sh``
with ``pip install -e .`` when your PWD is the root of the NeMo repository.

Mac computers with Apple silicon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install NeMo on Mac with Apple M-Series GPU:

- create a new Conda environment

- install PyTorch 2.0 or higher

- run the following code:

.. code-block:: shell

    # [optional] install mecab using Homebrew, to use sacrebleu for NLP collection
    # you can install Homebrew here: https://brew.sh
    brew install mecab

    # [optional] install pynini using Conda, to use text normalization
    conda install -c conda-forge pynini

    # install Cython manually
    pip install cython packaging

    # clone the repo and install in development mode
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
    cd NeMo
    pip install 'nemo_toolkit[all]'

    # Note that only the ASR toolkit is guaranteed to work on MacBook - so for MacBook use pip install 'nemo_toolkit[asr]'

Windows Computers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the options is using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

To install WSL:

- In PowerShell, run the following code:

.. code-block:: shell

    wsl --install
    # [note] If you run wsl --install and see the WSL help text, it means WSL is already installed.

Learn more about installing WSL at `Microsoft's official documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_.

After Installing your Linux distribution with WSL:
  - **Option 1:** Open the distribution (Ubuntu by default) from the Start menu and follow the instructions.
  - **Option 2:** Launch the Terminal application. Download it from `Microsoft's Windows Terminal page <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal>`_ if not installed.

Next, follow the instructions for Linux systems, as provided above. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
    cd NeMo
    ./reinstall.sh

RNNT
~~~~
Note that RNNT requires numba to be installed from conda.

.. code-block:: bash

  conda remove numba
  pip uninstall numba
  conda install -c conda-forge numba

LLM and Multimodal Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LLM and Multimodal domains require three additional dependencies: 
NVIDIA Apex, NVIDIA Transformer Engine, and NVIDIA Megatron Core.

When working with the `main` branch these dependencies may require a recent commit.
The most recent working versions of these dependencies are:

.. code-block:: bash

  export apex_commit=810ffae374a2b9cb4b5c5e28eaeca7d7998fca0c
  export te_commit=bfe21c3d68b0a9951e5716fb520045db53419c5e
  export mcore_commit=fbb375d4b5e88ce52f5f7125053068caff47f93f
  export nv_pytorch_tag=24.02-py3

When using a released version of NeMo, 
please refer to the `Software Component Versions <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/softwarecomponentversions.html>`_ 
for the correct versions.

If starting with a base NVIDIA PyTorch container first launch the container:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker run \
    --gpus all \
    -it \
    --rm \
    --shm-size=16g \
    --ulimit memlock=-1 \
    --ulimit stack=67108864 \
    nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:$nv_pytorch_tag

Then install the dependencies:

Apex
~~~~
NeMo LLM Multimodal Domains require that NVIDIA Apex to be installed.
Apex comes installed in the NVIDIA PyTorch container but it's possible that
NeMo LLM and Multimodal may need to be updated to a newer version.

To install Apex, run

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex.git
    cd apex
    git checkout $apex_commit
    pip install . -v --no-build-isolation --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir --config-settings "--build-option=--cpp_ext --cuda_ext --fast_layer_norm --distributed_adam --deprecated_fused_adam --group_norm"


While installing Apex outside of the NVIDIA PyTorch container,
it may raise an error if the CUDA version on your system does not match the CUDA version torch was compiled with.
This raise can be avoided by commenting it here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex/blob/master/setup.py#L32

cuda-nvprof is needed to install Apex. The version should match the CUDA version that you are using:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install -c nvidia cuda-nvprof=11.8

packaging is also needed:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install packaging

With the latest versions of Apex, the `pyproject.toml` file in Apex may need to be deleted in order to install locally.


Transformer Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NeMo LLM Multimodal Domains require that NVIDIA Transformer Engine to be installed.
Transformer Engine comes installed in the NVIDIA PyTorch container but it's possible that
NeMo LLM and Multimodal may need Transformer Engine to be updated to a newer version.

Transformer Engine enables FP8 training on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs and many performance optimizations for transformer-based model training.
Documentation for installing Transformer Engine can be found `here <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/installation.html>`_. 

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine.git && \
  cd TransformerEngine && \
  git checkout $te_commit && \
  git submodule init && git submodule update && \
  NVTE_FRAMEWORK=pytorch NVTE_WITH_USERBUFFERS=1 MPI_HOME=/usr/local/mpi pip install .

Transformer Engine requires PyTorch to be built with at least CUDA 11.8.

Megatron Core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NeMo LLM Multimodal Domains require that NVIDIA Megatron Core to be installed.
Megatron core is a library for scaling large transfromer base models. 
NeMo LLM and Multimodal models leverage Megatron Core for model parallelism, 
transformer architectures, and optimized pytorch datasets.

NeMo LLM and Multimodal may need Megatron Core to be updated to a recent version.

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM.git && \
  cd Megatron-LM && \
  git checkout $mcore_commit && \
  pip install . && \
  cd megatron/core/datasets && \
  make


NeMo Text Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NeMo Text Processing, specifically (Inverse) Text Normalization, is now a separate repository `https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-text-processing <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-text-processing>`_.

Docker containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We release NeMo containers alongside NeMo releases. For example, NeMo ``r1.23.0`` comes with container ``nemo:24.01.speech``, you may find more details about released containers in `releases page <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/releases>`_.

To use a pre-built container, please run

.. code-block:: bash

    docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.01.speech

To build a nemo container with Dockerfile from a branch, please run

.. code-block:: bash

    DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f Dockerfile -t nemo:latest .


If you choose to work with the main branch, we recommend using NVIDIA's PyTorch container version 23.10-py3 and then installing from GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v <nemo_github_folder>:/NeMo --shm-size=8g \
    -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit \
    stack=67108864 --device=/dev/snd nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.10-py3
